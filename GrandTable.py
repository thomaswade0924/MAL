# NOTE: This is a suggestion of how you could begin implementing the Grand Table,
# feel free to come up with your own way. You may change almost everything of this class,
# it just has to calculate the grand table on a matrix suite,
#  given a list of strategies, restarts and rounds per restart.

class GrandTable:
    """Calculate the grand table on a MatrixSuite for the given strategies, restarts and rounds per restart.

    Class attributes:
        *matrix_suite*: The MatrixSuite that the game is played on,
        should generate a new payoff matrix after each restart.

        *row_strategies*: List of N instances of Strategy subclasses, which should be included in the Grand Table.

        *col_strategies*: List of N instances of Strategy subclasses, which should be included in the Grand Table.

        Either row or col strategies should be a deepcopy of strategies so they don't refer to the same instances.
        Credit: Thanks Vincent and Wiebe for noticing that this is necessary.

        *restarts*: Number of restarts that should occur during the calculation of the Grand Table.

        *rounds*: Number of rounds that should be played for each restart.

        *games*: Instance of Game for every combination of *strategies*, so N x N.
        The outer list are row players and the inner list are column players.

        *grand_table*: Same 2D list as *games* but only contains the resulting score.
